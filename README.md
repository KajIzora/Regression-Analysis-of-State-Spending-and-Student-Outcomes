# Analysis of State Spending and Student Outcomes

This project examines the relationship between state education spending and student performance, as measured by SAT scores. The dataset includes information on per-pupil expenditure, pupil-teacher ratios, teacher salaries, the percentage of students taking the SAT, and their average total SAT scores. The goal is to determine whether higher education spending correlates with improved student outcomes and to identify which factors have the most significant impact on test scores.

The analysis begins with an exploratory data review, assessing summary statistics and identifying states with notably high or low spending, teacher salaries, and student-teacher ratios. This initial investigation reveals a counterintuitive trend: states that spend the least per pupil tend to have higher SAT scores. However, these states also have significantly lower percentages of students taking the test, suggesting that only the most motivated students sit for the SAT, potentially inflating the average scores. 

To better understand these relationships, correlation tests are conducted to examine the association between education spending, teacher salaries, pupil-teacher ratios, and SAT scores. The analysis finds that while spending and salaries have moderate negative correlations with total SAT scores, the percentage of students taking the test has the strongest relationship, making it difficult to isolate the effect of spending alone. To address this, two approaches are used: filtering the data to focus on states with high SAT participation and using multiple regression models to control for test-taker percentages. Neither approach finds a significant independent relationship between spending and SAT scores once participation rates are accounted for.

The study is conducted using R, leveraging libraries such as **ggplot2** for data visualization, **dplyr** for data manipulation, **faraway** for regression modeling, **Hmisc** for correlation analysis, and **ppcor** for partial correlations. These tools help to systematically examine relationships between variables and assess the statistical significance of different predictors.

The findings suggest that education spending does not have a straightforward impact on SAT scores, largely because SAT participation rates vary widely across states. Higher participation rates tend to lower average scores, making it difficult to determine whether increased spending genuinely improves student performance. A more accurate way to measure the effect of spending on education quality may require using a more universal academic measure, such as GPA or standardized tests taken by nearly all students.
